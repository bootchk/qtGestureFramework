qtGestureFramework
==================

classes supporting gesture for Python3, PyQt5

Useful for learning, experimentation, testing when you don't actually have a trackpad or touchscreen.

GPLv3

A custom gesture and recognizer simulating a two-finger pinch from the mouse.
The pinch gesture is important to recognize since many laptop trackpads recognize it.
Apple HIG suggest that your app handle it: users expect it to work in all apps.

A simple app/test program that uses it.

Other classes such as EventDumper

Issues for exploration:
- how to enable which widgets for touch and gesture events
- the states of gestures
- releasing gesture objects in PyQt without crash on exit
